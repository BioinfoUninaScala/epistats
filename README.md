## EpiStatProfiler
#### A new R package for the qualitative analysis of DNA methylation

### Introduction 

<p align = "justify">

*EpiStatProfiler* is a new R package aimed to extract epialleles from any type of bisulfite-sequencing data (from targeted to genome-wide experimental data). The   epiallele-based analysis (EBA) relies on the characterization of the specific methylation patterns present on each sequenced molecule of a sequencing experiment. 
Given a genomic locus containing n Cs in the CpX context, all the possible combinations of the methylation states of these Cs are defined as *epialleles*. 
This type of analysis can provide additional insights about the epigenetic cellular heterogeneity characterizing a sample
